### 42 Cursus Project 7

**Score: 125/125**

In this project, I created a program that reads a map file and opens a graphical window to display it <br/>
The map is represented as a 3D wireframe, in isometric or parallel projection <br/>
For the bonus, I implemented navigation features such as translation, rotation and zoom <br/>
I also implemented a HUD that displays keybinds and live stats, as well as height and color change
